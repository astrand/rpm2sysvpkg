rpm2sysvpkg
===========

The rpm2sysvpkg project aims to provide Open Source tools for creating
and handling Solaris and System V packages. It currently contains two
tools:

* rpm2sysvpkg: A tool which converts RPM packages to System V
  packages.

* pkgtrans: A tool for translating package formats, from the
  datastream format to the file system format, or vice versa. This
  tool aims to work exactly like the Solaris pkgtrans command.
